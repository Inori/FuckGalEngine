  Range encoding is based on an article by G.N.N. Martin, submitted
  March 1979 and presented on the Video & Data Recording Conference,
  Southampton, July 24-27, 1979. If anyone can name the original
  copyright holder of that article please contact me; this might
  allow me to make that article available on the net for general
  public.

  Range coding is closely related to arithmetic coding, except that
  it does renormalisation in larger units than bits and is thus
  faster. An earlier version of this code was distributed as byte
  oriented arithmetic coding, but then I had no knowledge of Martin's
  paper from 1979.

  The input and output is done by the INBYTE and OUTBYTE macros
  defined in the .c file; change them as needed; the first parameter
  passed to them is a pointer to the rangecoder structure; extend that
  structure as needed (and don't forget to initialize the values in
  start_encoding resp. start_decoding). This distribution writes to
  stdout and reads from stdin.

  There are no global or static var's, so if the IO is thread save the
  whole rangecoder is - unless GLOBALRANGECODER in rangecod.h is defined.

  For error recovery the last 3 bytes written contain the total number
  of bytes written since starting the encoder. This can be used to
  locate the beginning of a block if you have only the end.

  For some application using a global coder variable may provide a better
  performance. This will allow you to use only one coder at a time and
  will destroy thread savety. To enabble this feature uncomment the
  #define GLOBALRANGECODER line below.
